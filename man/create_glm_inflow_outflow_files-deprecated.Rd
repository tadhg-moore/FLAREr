\title{Generating inflow and output files in the GLM format}
\usage{
create_glm_inflow_outflow_files(
  inflow_file_dir = NULL,
  inflow_obs,
  working_directory,
  config,
  state_names
)
}
\arguments{
\item{inflow_file_dir}{string; full directory path that contains forecasted inflow and outflow files}

\item{inflow_obs}{string; full path to cleaned inflow observation in the specified format}

\item{working_directory}{string; full directory where FLARE executes}

\item{state_names}{vector; vector of state names that will be included in the inflow files}
}
\value{
list with two vectors. One vector is the matrix of inflow_file_names and the other is the matrix of outflow_file_names
}
\description{
Generating inflow and output files in the GLM format
}
\details{
Processes historical inflow data from inflow_obs and from files in the inflow_file_dir into the GLM format
