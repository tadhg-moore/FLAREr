A guide to the variables in `configure_flare.yml` and in the `observations_config.csv`,
`parameter_calibration_config.csv`, and `states_config.csv`.

## General set-up

*  `model_name`: specific ID of the model (`glm_aed` and `null` are the only 

## Lake specific variables

* `lake_name_code`: four letter code name for lake.
* `lake_name`: full name of lake
* `lake_latitude`: Degrees North
* `lake_longitude`: Degrees West
* `local_tzone`: In standard time. Must be recognized by R.

## Weather forcing options
* `use_future_met`
  * `TRUE`: use NOAA forecast for "Future"
  * `FALSE` = use observed weather for "Future"; only works if "forecasting" 
    past dates
* `forecast_met_model`:  directory name within the data_location that contains the NOAA model output (i.e., NOAAGEFS_1hr-debias)



## Inflow options

* `use_future_inflow`: Use forecast inflow vs. observed inflow (if available)
  * `TRUE`: Future inflow
  * `FALSE`: Observed inflow
* `forecast_inflow_model`: directory name within the data_location that contains the inflow model output (i.e., FLOWS-NOAAGEFS-AR1)

## GLM namelist files

* `base_GLM_nml`: full path to the glm namelist or path relative to forecast directory
* `base_AED_nml`: full path to the aed namelist or path relative to forecast directory
* `base_AED_phyto_pars_nml`: full path to the phyto_pars namelist or path relative to forecast directory
* `base_AED_zoop_pars_nml`: full path to the zoop_pars namelist or path relative to forecast directory

## Depth information

* `modeled_depths`: Vector of depths are that represented in the data assimilation

## Data assimilation description
* `da_method`: method for data assimilation (`enkf` or `pf` or `none`)
* `par_fit_method`: method for parameter fitting
  * if `da_method` = `enkf`, then `inflate` or `perturb` are options
  * if `da_method` = `pf`, then only `perturb` is an option
* `ensemble_size`: Total number of ensemble members
* `vert_decorr_length`: The length in meters where process uncertainty becomes
   decoupled.
* `no_negative_states`: Set any states that become negative do to the addition 
   of process uncertainty or from EnKF update to zero
* `localization_distance`: distance in meters were covariances in the model 
   error are used
* `assimilate_first_step`: TRUE or FALSE
* `ncore`: number of computer cores to use for parrallel processing

## Parameter calibration information

* `par_file`: 
  * `par_names`: vector of GLM names of parameter values estimated
  * `par_names_save`: vector of names of parameter values estimated  that are 
     desired in output and plots
  * `par_nml`: vector of nml file names that contains the parameter that is being 
     estimated
  * `par_init_mean`: vector of initial mean value for parameters
  * `par_init_lowerbound`: vector of lower bound for the initial uniform 
     distribution of the parameters
  * `par_init_upperbound`: vector of upper bound for the initial uniform 
     distribution of the parameters
  * `par_lowerbound`: vector of lower bounds that a parameter can have
  * `par_upperbound`: vector of upper bounds that a parameter can have
  * `inflat_pars`: The variance inflation factor applied to the parameter 
     component of the ensemble. Value greater than 1.
  * `pertrub_par`: The standard deviation of the normally distributed random noise that is added to parameters
  * `par_units`: Units of parameter for plotting

## State information

* `states_config.csv`:
  * `state_names`: name of states.  
  * `initial_conditions`: The initial conditions for the state if observations
     are not available to initialize.  Assumes the initial conditions are 
     constant over all depths, except for temperature which uses the `default_temp_init`
     variable in `configure_flare.R` to set the depth profile when observations
     are lacking
  * `model_sd`: the standard deviation of the process error for the tate
  * `initial_model_sd`: the standard deviation on the initial distribution of the state
  * `states_to_obs_mapping`: a multiplier on the state to convert to the observation.
     In most cases this is 1.  However, in the case of phytoplankton,  the model
     predicts mmol/m3 biomass but the observations are ug/L chla.  Therefore the multiplier
     is the biomass to chla conversion
  * `states_to_obs_1`: The observation that the state contributes to
    * `NA` is required if no matching observations
    * Name in this column must match an observation name
  * `states_to_obs_2`: A second observation that the state contributes to
    * `NA` is required if no matching observations
    * Name in this column must match an observation name
  * `init_obs_name`: the name of observation that is used to initialize the state
     if there is an observation
  * `init_obs_mapping`: a multiplier on the observation when used to initialize.
     For example, if using a combined DOC measurement to initialize two DOC 
     states, you need to provide the proportion of the observation that is 
     assigned to each state.
     
* `states_process_error.csv`:
  * `depth`
  * column name = variable name for states that have depth varying process uncertainity

## Observation information

* `obs_config_file`:
  * `state_names_obs`: names of states with observations
  * `obs_sd`: the standard deviation of the observation uncertainty
  * `target_variable`: the name of variable in the data file that is used for the observed state.
  * `distance_threshold`: this is the distances in meters that an 
  observation has to be within to be matched to a value in `modeled_depths`..

## Initial Conditions (GLM)

* `lake_depth_init`: initial lake depth (meters)
* `default_temp_init`: vector of initial temperature profile
* `default_temp_init_depths`: vector of depths in initial temperature profile
* `the_sals_init`: vector of initial salinty values
* `default_snow_thickness_init`: initial snow thickness (cm)
* `default_white_ice_thickness_init`:  initial white ice thickness (cm)
* `default_blue_ice_thickness_init`: initial blue ice thickness (cm)

## Management specific variables

* `simulate_SSS`: include SSS (bottom-water oxygenation) in simulations with 
  observed drivers (i.e., data assimilation simulations)
  * `TRUE`: include
  * `FALSE`: don't include
* `forecast_no_SSS`: Include SSS in forecast
  * `TRUE`: include
  * `FALSE`: don't include
* `use_specified_sss`: Use sss inflow and oxygen from file in forecast.  If 
  `FALSE` then provide `forecast_SSS_flow` and `forecast_SSS_Oxy`.
* `forecast_SSS_flow`: Flow rate of SSS in forecast (m3/day)
* `forecast_SSS_Oxy`: Oxygen concentration of SSS in forecast (mmol/m3)
* `sss_fname`: full path to the file that has the SSS Flow and oxygen data
* `sss_inflow_factor`: a scalar to multiply FLOW rate of SSS
* `sss_depth`: The depth (meters) of the SSS inflow/outflow
